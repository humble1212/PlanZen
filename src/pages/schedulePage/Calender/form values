A scalable to-do app typically requires the following basic input values:

1. Task name (string): A brief description of the task.
2. Task description (string): A detailed description of the task.
3. Due date (date): The date by which the task should be completed.
4. Priority (enum): A priority level (e.g., low, medium, high) to indicate the task's importance.
5. Status (enum): A status indicator (e.g., todo, in progress, done) to track the task's progress.
6. Tags (array of strings): Optional tags or labels to categorize and filter tasks.
7. Assignee (string or user ID): The person responsible for completing the task.
8. Created at (date): The date the task was created.
9. Updated at (date): The date the task was last updated.

These input values provide a solid foundation for a scalable to-do app, allowing users to create, manage, and track their tasks effectively.

Additional input values to consider:

1. Task duration (number): Estimated time required to complete the task.
2. Task dependencies (array of task IDs): Dependencies or prerequisites for the task.
3. Task notes (string): Additional notes or comments related to the task.
4. Task attachments (array of files): Files or documents attached to the task.

These additional input values can enhance the app's functionality and user experience, but may not be essential for a basic to-do app.
